# Explainable AI applied to ECG signal

# What is this?

This repository contains the references for my Final Project for the Electrical Engineering course at the Federal Institute of Espirito Santo ([Ifes](https://www.ifes.edu.br/))
in Brazil. The project is about the application of Explainable AI (XAI) in the analysis of ECG signals. The goal is to develop a model that can classify ECG signals and provide explanations for its predictions.
